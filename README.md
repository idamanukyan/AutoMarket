# AutoMarket
AutoMarket is a car selling and buying application developed using pure Java, servlets, and HTML/CSS. The aim of this project is to provide a user-friendly platform for car dealers and buyers to easily sell or purchase their desired cars. The application allows users to search for cars based on different criteria such as model, brand, price range, etc. It also provides features for car dealers to add new cars to the inventory, update or delete existing cars, and manage the sales process. The application is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use, with a clean and modern user interface. The codebase is available on GitHub for developers to contribute, learn, and improve their skills in web development with Java and servlets.
